The discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation by \citet{1965ApJ...142..419P}
provided the first direct evidence that the universe had a beginning. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery, and astronomers have been studying this
radiation ever since. In fact, a second Nobel Prize was awarded to John Mather and George Smoot in
2006 for their work on the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, which was amongst the first
experiments to demonstrate that the background radiation was anisotropic
\citep{1992ApJ...396L...1S}. These studies of the CMB have fundamentally advanced humanity's
understanding of the universe: its origin, evolution, and composition.
