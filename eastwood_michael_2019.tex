\begin{acknowledgements}
    This thesis would not have been possible without the support of my family and friends.

    First, and most importantly, \ty to my parents whom have always been my first port of call for
    advice and support.  \Ty to Shawn for his extraordinary patience in helping me pass my first
    physics class, and teaching me through example that math is rewarding (although I still maintain
    my assertion that math is a subfield of physics).  \Ty to Kevin for being my lifelong friend.

    \Ty to my entire thesis committee, but especially to my advisor Gregg Hallinan.

    Sebastian

    Melodie

    Jackie

    \Ty to Marin Anderson for being a wonderful friend and peer. We started on the OVRO-LWA project
    together,

    Ryan M

    \Ty to Stephen Bourke and Jake Hartman without whom the OVRO-LWA would not be the instrument it
    is today. \Ty to Harish Vedantham whose patient and thorough discussions with me were often
    extremely influential in helping me find new direction in my research.

    \Ty to the entire Owens Valley Radio Observatory staff, without whom the OVRO-LWA would not even
    exist.

    \Ty to Richard Shaw for developing the $m$-mode analysis framework that was foundational for
    this thesis, and to Adrian Liu who first introduced me to his work.

    \Ty to Gita Patel and Althea Keith for dealing with my occasional delinquency.

    \Ty to Patrick Shopbell

    \Ty to my mentor Ryan Trainor, who in spite of the fact that he is a Liverpool fan, helped me
    settle and find my feet within the Caltech community. \Ty to Jacob Jencson and Chris Bochenek

    Caltech peoples

    Judd, Tzu-Ching, Sievers

    Maci, Eva, John

    \Ty to professors Marjorie Corcoran, Christopher Johns-Krull, Patrick Hartigan, James
    Hannon, Mark Embree, and Anthony Chan who collectively guided me through my time at Rice
    University.

    \Ty to everybody who has played on the Cataclysmics soccer team. We occasionally won a game or
    two. Maybe results will improve with the new management.

    Finally, \ty to Jessica Tran for helping me grow in my faith and praying the rosary with
    me daily.
