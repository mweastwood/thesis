    This thesis would not have been possible without the support of my family and friends.

    First, and most importantly, \ty to my parents whom have always been my first port of call for
    advice and support.  \Ty to Shawn for his extraordinary patience in helping me pass my first
    physics class, and teaching me through example that math is rewarding (although I still maintain
    my assertion that math is a subfield of physics).  \Ty to Kevin for being my lifelong friend.
    \Ty to all of my family---my cousins, my nieces and nephews---who are too numerous to mention
    all by name here.

    \Ty to my entire thesis committee, but especially to my advisor Gregg Hallinan. Gregg was a
    model advisor to me and a very good friend. \Ty for your support and assistance throughout my
    graduate school career, and my decision to pursue a career in software engineering.

    \Ty to Marin Anderson for being a wonderful friend and peer. We started on the OVRO-LWA project
    together, struggled with faulty lasers, short circuits, and \texttt{lustre} together, and I wish
    you all future success.

    \Ty to Ryan Monroe who is a wizard (at least level 3). I value the perspective and insight you
    brought to every difficulty, and you never backed down from a difficult challenge. For that
    reason I know your start-up is going to be tremendously successful.

    \Ty to Sebastian Pineda for all the time we spent ``secretly'' watching soccer instead of doing
    actual work, although watching the USMNT definitely feels like actual work at times.
    
    \Ty to Melodie Kao for her ever-present support, and \ty to her cats for their ever-present
    stinkiness and for occasionally sitting on my lap.
    
    \Ty to Stephen Bourke and Jake Hartman without whom the OVRO-LWA would not be the instrument it
    is today. \Ty to Harish Vedantham whose patient and thorough discussions with me were often
    extremely influential in helping me find new directions in my research.

    A huge \ty to the entire Owens Valley Radio Observatory staff, without whom the OVRO-LWA would
    not even exist.

    \Ty to my mentor Ryan Trainor, who in spite of the fact that he is a Liverpool fan (ugh), helped
    me settle and find my feet within the Caltech community. \Ty to my mentees Jacob Jencson and
    Chris Bochenek, I have no doubt that you two will find success in the remainder of your graduate
    school careers.

    \Ty to my friends at Caltech, especially Yi Cao, Io Kleiser, and all of my peers.

    \Ty to Gita Patel and Althea Keith for dealing with my occasional delinquency.

    \Ty to Patrick Shopbell, Anu Mahabal, and Carl Smay for patiently dealing with the slew of
    technical problems that Marin and I would send their way.

    \Ty to Judd Bowman, Tzu-Ching Chang, and Jonathan Sievers for considering me to join their
    research groups. Even though it wasn't to be, I am extremely grateful.

    \Ty to professors Marjorie Corcoran, Christopher Johns-Krull, Patrick Hartigan, James
    Hannon, Mark Embree, and Anthony Chan who collectively guided me through my time at Rice
    University.

    \Ty to Richard Shaw for developing the $m$-mode analysis framework that was foundational for
    this thesis, and to Adrian Liu who first introduced me to his work.

    \Ty to everybody who has played on the Cataclysmics soccer team. We occasionally won a game or
    two. Maybe results will improve with the new management.

    Finally, \ty to Jessica Tran for helping me grow in my faith and praying the rosary with me.
